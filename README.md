## Project Overview :

The Youtube Engagement System project leverages Python libraries and machine learning algorithms to perform the following tasks:

1) Analyze views data from youtube to gain insights into various aspects of the business.

2) Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and identify patterns, trends, and outliers.

3) Visualize the data using charts and graphs to provide meaningful representations of the vital information.

4) Train a machine learning model to predict future Likes based on historical data.

5) Evaluate the model's performance and make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Libraries Used:

1) pandas

2) numpy 

3) matplotlib 

4) seaborn 

5) scikit-learn

6) Squarify

7) Google.Colab
